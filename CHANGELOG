1.10 (November 2013)

* Bugfix:
	- the xmlcgi input filter would potentially return more data
	  than the downstream filter asked for. This seems to be
	  fine for some backends, but php5 croaks on this.

	  Fixed by using a temporary bucket-brigade.

1.9: (August 2012)

* Bugfix:
	- mod_proxy needs unparsed_uri to be set in the request
	  structure in Apache 2.2.22. Fixed by calling ap_parse_uri.

	- Eliminate compiler warnings

	- logout clears information about the session now
	  after calling the handler.

1.8: (April 2011)

* Bugfix:
	- Handle TRANSIENT buckets correctly when collecting a long
	  answer from the backend.

* New features:
	- new program async-epptelnet.pl: Same as epptelnet.pl,
	  minus SSL and other frills, but can do async operations.

1.6: (December 2009)

* Bugfix: Internal EPP error messages work again
* Default value for EPPAuthURI
* New config statement: EPPReturncodeHeader
	- Backend can signal EPP RC to mod_epp

	- uses either HTTP error code or via EPPReturncodeHeader
	  of the <login> command.
* New feature: User-Agent: header set
* Bufix/Feature: Connection close now works on mod_proxy
	- X-Connection
	- via EPP return code
