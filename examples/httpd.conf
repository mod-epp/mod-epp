# Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) Support

# To be able to use the functionality of a module which was built as a DSO you
# have to place corresponding `LoadModule' lines at this location so the
# directives contained in it are actually available _before_ they are used.
# Statically compiled modules (those listed by `httpd -l') do not need
# to be loaded here.

# There is not much point in doing mod_epp configuration if the

# First of all, we need a port on which we listen on for incoming
# EPP connections. According to IANA, TCP port number 3121 is
# reserved for EPP use. See http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers
#
# We do not know whether 3121 should be plain EPP over TCP or 
# includes SSL, thus we just use 3121 for unencrypted and 3132 for
# SSL enabled EPP in this example.
#

# epp-temp        3121/tcp   Extensible Provisioning Protocol
Listen  3121

#
# Next, we do configuration specific to this Port == VirtualHost
#
<VirtualHost *:3121>

#
# No HTTP on this port, sir. We want to speak EPP here. 
# I use version 6 here because epptt does not suppport version 7
# yet. See http://sourceforge.net/projects/epptt/

# 
# mod_epp uses the EPP*Root statements to define the prefix for
# the requests built from the EPP frame. For example:
# <epp><command><create>[...] will be mapped to 
# $EPPCommandRoot/create.
#
# EPPCommandRoot is for regular EPP commands like
#	<create> <check> <info> <poll> <transfer> ...
#	mod_epp does not try to interpret these EPP commands
#	at all, it only extracts the command name and builds the
#	request URI from it.
#
# EPPSessionRoot is for interactions concerning the session
#	handling of mod_epp. Possible commands here are
#	hello, login, logout, bye
#
# EPPErrorRoot is used when mod_epp detects an error, and
# 	delegates the generation of a proper EPP error message
#	to the script subsystem. Expect calls to:
#	schema, parse, login, protocol, authrequired, internal
#
#	If the call to such a script fails, mod_epp will try
#	to formulate a reasonable error message.
#

#
# One approach to the configuration here is to point all
# EPP*Roots to directories and put individual scripts in these.
#
# Another approach is to just use one script for each class
# and use the CGI variable PATH_INFO to call the appropriate
# subroutine within the script.
#
# Or: point the EPP*Roots to a default handler and use
# Alias directives to redirect specific requests to 
# scripts dedicated to process just this request.
# This is the setup I use here.
# As /cgi-bin is defined as ScriptAlias, the Aliases
# used here are interfering with this ScriptAlias, thus
# the <Directory> statement outside this Vhost.

#
# these are the catchall scripts.
