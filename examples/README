In this directory you find a basic set of files 
which demonstrate the configuration of mod_epp
and the give examples for the neccessary scripting
environment.

httpd.conf is an Apache config file snippet
containing all directives relating to mod_epp.
I installed the server under /home/lendl/apache2, please
adapt the paths to your setup.

You need to copy the files from examples/cgis
to $apacheroot/cgi-bin/epp, and copy the files from
examples/static to $apacheroot/htdocs/epp
in order to get a working setup.

example.key and example.crt can be used in conjunction 
with epptelnet.pl to test SSL with client certs.

The *.xml files are just some basic EPP example
I use for testing the server.
